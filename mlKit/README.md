# Song Recommendation Systems

Provides scripts and jobs to generate ML recommendations for musicroom.
Currently supports:
- User based Colaborative Filtering Technique - for recommending tracks for each user based on their activity.

## Usage

```
bash mlKit/user_rs.sh
```

Note: These files must exist before running the script:
- mlKit/data/input/listening_history.csv
- mlKit/data/input/target_users.csv

Use mr server's `export_rs_data` command to generate those. It will place those files in the correct locations.

```
python manage.py export_rs_data
```

## File structure

- `user_rs/`
- - `demo/`
- - rs_script.py
- - Recommendor.py
- `data/`
- - `input/`
- - `output/`
- - `tmp/`

## Demo

- `job.ipynb` - only requires `listening_history.csv` file.
- `Collaborative Filtering Song Recommendation System.ipynb` - (analysis)
- 2 other data processing notebooks, run them before the previous one.

 Files required to run analysis (`data/input/`):
- [mxm_779k_matches.txt](http://millionsongdataset.com/sites/default/files/AdditionalFiles/mxm_779k_matches.txt.zip)
- [train_triplets.txt](http://millionsongdataset.com/sites/default/files/challenge/train_triplets.txt.zip)
- [track_metadata.db](http://millionsongdataset.com/sites/default/files/AdditionalFiles/track_metadata.db)
- [unique_tracks.txt](http://millionsongdataset.com/sites/default/files/AdditionalFiles/unique_tracks.txt)

 Files generated by data processing notebooks (required by the main notebook) (`data/tmp/`):
 - listening_history.csv
 - tracks_metadata.csv
 - seeds.csv
